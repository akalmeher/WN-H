A Group Project for the course CSC 317: Intro to Web Software Development

An AI Chatbot site using full-stack development tools including Linux, Node, and MySQL. 

We will use HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript for the website.

The public folder consists of the files (HTML and images) and write-ups including website screenshots, showing the development's progression.

The website uses node.js for the server and MySQL database.
